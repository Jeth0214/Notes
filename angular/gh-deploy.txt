// Error handling 
scenario 1: error: Invalid version: "15.2-15.3"

Possible Answer: Run 
npm audit fix --force
npm audit fix
npm update

scenario 2: This version of CLI is only compatible with Angular versions ^13.0.0, but Angular version 12.2.13 was found instead
Possible answer:
Try to change "@angular-devkit/build-angular": "< your version here >" in package.json file.
Close the editor and try again.

npm i @angular-devkit/build-angular@12.2.13 --force
npm i @angular/cli@12

Note: 
Wait for the newest deployment to be active. Try to refresh your github page if it is in pending or processing status
Also, refresh the deployment page or the given url.
